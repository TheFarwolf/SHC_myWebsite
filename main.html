			<h1>The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger</h1>
			<p>The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.
			So begins Book I of Stephen King’s iconic fantasy series,
			The Dark Tower. Part sci-fi novel, part futuristic dystopia,
			part spaghetti Western, and part high fantasy vision,
			The Gunslinger tells the story of Roland Deschain, Mid-World’s
			last gunslinger, who is tracking an enigmatic magician known only
			as the man in black. Following his quarry across the demon-infested
			Mohaine Desert, Roland confronts a mad preacher woman and her
			murderous flock, holds palaver with a speaking demon, and
			finally befriends a young boy from our world named Jake
			Chambers. Jake joins Roland on his quest, but while Roland
			travels with his young companion Jake, the man in black travels
			with Roland’s soul in his pocket.</p>
