        <h1 class="project_title">DevCatts.me</h1>
        <h3 class="p_">The Idea</h3>
        <p class="p_">DevCatts.me is the first website that I have created with the intention of hosting it. It's a static site comprised of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <p class="p_">The purpose of DevCatts.me is to act as a running tracker for my personal development projects and also to act as an example of my work itself for potential employers.</p>
        <h3 class="p_">The Design</h3>
        <p class="p_">For the overall design of the site I wanted it to be minimal with high clarity. Things that actively contribute to this are the minimal color scheme, outgoing link icons and minmal number of actualy HTML pages. I would rather have my projects folded down on one page rather than a bunch of different pages. A page/file for every project that I have listed would add a lot of navigation work for me and also take away ease of site navigation.</p>
        <h3 class="p_">The Documentation</h3>
        <p class="p_">DevCatts is hosted using Amazon Web Services(AWS). Figuring out how to host the code was much more simple than I expected, from creating an AWS account to having my site hosted was probably about 40 mins, half of which was spent reading documentation.</p>
